Lunar Haze

Instructions for players: 

Move the players using the arrow keys. The main objective of this prototype is
to collect all the lighted moonlight tiles on the map. To collect moonlight,
you must stand on the tile for two consecutive seconds. However, standing on
a moonlight tile will also reveal you to the enemy.

You can press Esc to go back to the menu while playing. Once you win the game,
you can press r to restart.

How the enemy works:

The enemy will walk in a set patrol path. Their current line of vision is a
line. Once you get into an enemy's sight, they will chase you until you are
out of a set chase distance.
